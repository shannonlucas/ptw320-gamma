# PTW 320 Project Gamma

This was the third team project for PTW 320 (Intermediate Technical Writing) at the University of Washington in Spring of 2022.

Team members and roles:

- Jennifer B. (writer) performed the audience analysis and wrote the project proposal and content.
- Sarah H. (editor) provided all levels of editing during the project.
- [Shannon L.](https://github.com/shannonlucas/) (production specialist) built the final deliverable and provided additional editing support.

## Project proposal

### Audience

Our target audience is comfortable creating files with the Microsoft programs Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, but is unsure how best to save their files. They first learned to use computers for word processing a decade or more ago, when files were primarily saved to single locations, such as a computerâ€™s hard drive, or to an external disc or jump drive. We call this group &ldquo;Generation Floppy Disc,&rdquo; or GFD for short. In addition to GFD, we have users in younger or older generations who have the same desire to learn how to save files. **Our audience's goal is to save their files with confidence.**

Our **core audience** is unclear about the differences between older methods of saving files, and how to perform the same task using newer cloud storage solutions. This confusion leads to frustration around saving their files, a necessary step before files can be sent to or shared with collaborators. Our **ring audience** consists of confident users of the latest versions of Microsoft programs and cloud storage. They may wish to share our deliverable or borrow its simple, straightforward language to assist GFD colleagues.

### Instructional problem statement

To enable our audience to save their files with confidence, our job-aid style deliverable will explain how to navigate the steps necessary to save their files without having to detour into in-product or external help resources.

## Production details

The content was initially written in Google Docs, and screenshots were captured using the built-in tools in Windows and macOS. Production involved migrating this content to HTML and CSS. These tools were used in that process:

- Adobe Photoshop was used to edit screen captures.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used to package and optimize the HTML, CSS, and other assets. It was also used to test the content locally.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) provides the core framework for the project's CSS.
- [Tailwind Elements](https://tailwind-elements.com) adds the tab panel interface components to select the instructions specific to each operating system.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is used to host the project online.
