## Project proposal

### Audience

Our target audience is comfortable creating files with the Microsoft programs Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, but is unsure how best to save their files. They first learned to use computers for word processing a decade or more ago, when files were primarily saved to single locations, such as a computerâ€™s hard drive, or to an external disc or jump drive. We call this group &ldquo;Generation Floppy Disc,&rdquo; or GFD for short. In addition to GFD, we have users in younger or older generations who have the same desire to learn how to save files. **Our audience's goal is to save their files with confidence.**

Our c**ore audience** is unclear about the differences between older methods of saving files, and how to perform the same task using newer cloud storage solutions. This confusion leads to frustration around saving their files, a necessary step before files can be sent to or shared with collaborators. Our **ring audience** consists of confident users of the latest versions of Microsoft programs and cloud storage. They may wish to share our deliverable or borrow its simple, straightforward language to assist GFD colleagues.

### Instructional problem statement

To enable our audience to save their files with confidence, our job-aid style deliverable will explain how to navigate the steps necessary to save their files without having to detour into in-product or external help resources.
